# Particle Life

Particle life is a project that showcases the phenomenon of emergence in action. First, define some simple rules that govern how particles of different colors interact with each other, then watch as thousands of particles attract and repel each other to form beautiful patterns and structures that seem to mirror simple multi cellular organisms.

# Inspiration

This project is an implementation of the [Particle Life Engine](https://particle-life.com/) created by [Tom Mohr](https://www.youtube.com/@tom-mohr). In specific, I have used the formula for determining particle interactions, and recreated many of the features present in Tom Mohr's project. I strongly recommend that you take a look at their work as they are a talented developer and laid the groundwork for me to create this project.
